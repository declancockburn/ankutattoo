PREPARATION
We recommend eating well and drinking plenty of water / juice / sugary drinks before your appointment. The night before our appointment, we prefer not to party at full throttle. Alcohol makes the blood thin so that our pigments are also diluted and it ultimately has a negative effect on the tattoo. Make sure you come to the appointment rested and calm, you are in good hands! We stock snacks to give you a boost should you start to feel a bit weak. Moreover, there is enough food, drinks, snacks and other goodies within 20 meters walking distance, if you feel the need!

AFTERCARE
The care after getting a tattoo partly determines the final result. During tattooing, the skin breaks, causing a wound. If you take good care of the tattoo, it will take about six weeks (depending on the size of the tattoo) for this wound to heal completely.

Here are some simple instructions that must be strictly followed for the best possible result;

- Let the foil sit for at least 3 hours.
- Wash your hands (Preferably with disinfectant soap, for example Unicura).
- Wash your tattoo gently with clean hands. Don't rub!
- Then dry your tattoo by dabbing gently with a clean, dry towel.
- Spread a tiny amount of Bepanthen on your tattoo with a clean finger.
- Put new foil around it.

Repeat this 2 times a day for the next 2 to 3 days.

If the tattoo feels dry, you can choose to rub this DUN with Bepanthen or with Vaseline Intensive Reque (unscented) body lotion. Make sure not to get too much ointment on the tattoo, as the skin can no longer breathe.
After 3 to 4 days, crusts / sheets appear on your tattoo; Do not scratch or pick! This can cause light spots in the tattoo. The crusts will eventually fall off by themselves.

Do's & Don't's during the healing process:
• If you get any irritation on your skin while wearing the foil, remove the foil. Wash the tattoo off with Unicura antibacterial soap and let it air out. However, continue to apply a thin layer of Bepanthen.
• Never wear tight, unwashed clothes or clothes containing hair or wool on the tattoo wound.

      <p>
        Anku is a Tattoo Artist from the small town of Miaoli in Taiwan. 
        Graduating with a degree in Graphic Design in 2012 she soon switched to her passion of tattooing, 
        opening her own studio in Taiwan in 2016. Moving to Eindhoven in 2020 
        meant starting over again unknown but also a new adventure.<br><br>
        
        
        Her work consists almost entirely of <i>custom designs</i> which means
        every client gets a new and unique creation from the elements that have meaning for them. 
        This way you're assured of an original design and not a copy of someone else's tattoo. 
        <br><br>
        I'm curious about your ideas and wishes! If you have them don't hesitate to send me a <a href="#contact">message</a>.

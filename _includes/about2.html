      <p>
        Browing up in Taiwan I've always had a passion
        for art and drawing. I graduated with a degree in Graphic
        Design in 2012 where I was already becoming fascinated
        with tattooing. It started with a classmate and no money...
        (we designed our own tattoos to apply on each-other).
        From there I was hooked and began to built my craft,
        studying and practicing, opening my own studio
        in Taiwan in 2016.

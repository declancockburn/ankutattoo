    <p>Tattooing should remain a creative affair, but there are a number of conditions and rules.</p>

<h3 id="minimum-18-years">MINIMUM 18 YEARS</h3>
<p>Tattooed from 18 years. Take your I.D. when you come to make an appointment.</p>

<h3 id="make-an-appointment">MAKE AN APPOINTMENT</h3>
<p>Tattooed by appointment. There is of course also room for walk-ins, but it may be that an appointment has just been scheduled. That is why the regular walk-in days will be announced via this site and social media. These are every 4 weeks, mainly on Mondays and Thursdays. So keep an eye on the messages!</p>

<p>To make an appointment, you come to the studio. We then discuss how we are going to approach things (in terms of design) and how many sessions will be needed. If you cannot come by, you can send an e-mail with the global info. You will receive a response as soon as possible with a number of dates where there would be room for you. If the date is set on both sides, a deposit will be requested to confirm the appointment. After confirming the appointment, you have to wait for the moment when you get your tattoo. You can request the design 5 working days in advance by e-mail (or by coming by). If any adjustments are needed, I will do this as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="cancel-an-appointment">CANCEL AN APPOINTMENT</h3>
<p>If the appointment is canceled at least 24 hours in advance, you can choose to get the deposit back in the form of a gift voucher or to take it with you to a new appointment. When canceling within 24 hours before the appointment, we are forced to take the down payment, because this is too short a day to find a new customer to fill the spot.</p>

<h3 id="price-determination">PRICE DETERMINATION</h3>
<p>We set our prices per tattoo and not with an hourly rate. You can request an indication of the price after your tattoo application has been approved. The exact price for your tattoo can be given once the design is ready.</p>

<h3 id="start-rate">START RATE</h3>
<p>Due to the hygienic handling and basic costs of the materials, we as a studio use a starting rate of € 60.</p>

<h3 id="deposit">DEPOSIT</h3>
<p>We ask for a deposit per tattoo to confirm the appointment, the amount may vary. This amount is eventually settled with the total price.</p>

<h3 id="payment">PAYMENT</h3>
<p>We prefer payment via PIN.</p>

<h3 id="guarantee">GUARANTEE</h3>
<p>You get a six-month warranty on your tattoos. If, for example, there is a light spot or the like within six months after getting your tattoo. you can make an appointment to update it completely free of charge.</p>

<h3 id="ink-passport">INK PASSPORT</h3>
<p>You will also receive an ink passport. this is currently recommended by the GGD. This will state which ink was used to get your tattoo. This is very easy because if you want to expand your tattoo in the future, we know exactly which ink we need to have it connect seamlessly.</p>

<h3 id="preparation">PREPARATION</h3>
<p>We recommend eating well and drinking plenty of water / juice / sugary drinks before your appointment. The night before our appointment, we prefer not to party at full throttle. Alcohol makes the blood thin so that our pigments are also diluted and it ultimately has a negative effect on the tattoo. Make sure you come to the appointment rested and calm, you are in good hands! We stock snacks to give you a boost should you start to feel a bit weak. Moreover, there is enough food, drinks, snacks and other goodies within 20 meters walking distance, if you feel the need!</p>

<h3 id="aftercare">AFTERCARE</h3>
<p>The care after getting a tattoo partly determines the final result. During tattooing, the skin breaks, causing a wound. If you take good care of the tattoo, it will take about six weeks (depending on the size of the tattoo) for this wound to heal completely.</p>

<p>Here are some simple instructions that must be strictly followed for the best possible result;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let the foil sit for at least 3 hours.</li>
  <li>Wash your hands (Preferably with disinfectant soap, for example Unicura).</li>
  <li>Wash your tattoo gently with clean hands. Don’t rub!</li>
  <li>Then dry your tattoo by dabbing gently with a clean, dry towel.</li>
  <li>Spread a tiny amount of Bepanthen on your tattoo with a clean finger.</li>
  <li>Put new foil around it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeat this 2 times a day for the next 2 to 3 days.</p>

<p>If the tattoo feels dry, you can choose to rub this DUN with Bepanthen or with Vaseline Intensive Reque (unscented) body lotion. Make sure not to get too much ointment on the tattoo, as the skin can no longer breathe.
After 3 to 4 days, crusts / sheets appear on your tattoo; Do not scratch or pick! This can cause light spots in the tattoo. The crusts will eventually fall off by themselves.</p>

<p>Do’s &amp; Don’t’s during the healing process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you get any irritation on your skin while wearing the foil, remove the foil. Wash the tattoo off with Unicura antibacterial soap and let it air out. However, continue to apply a thin layer of Bepanthen.</li>
  <li>Never wear tight, unwashed clothes or clothes containing hair or wool on the tattoo wound.</li>
</ul>

## Todo: 
* Take down old site (stop server, but check price first)
* Redirect ankutattoo to github site. (maybe under construction version?)
* Put first social icons in header (done) and fix size, colour etc. Anku says make smaller. 
* Why did bg images bounce before? And can I consciously get it back?
* Add draft site to social 
* Make social icons disappear from header when phone size.
* ^ Think about where to put them in that case.
* Add subtitle to home-page.
* Want grid/boxes in about-page to order as column instead of row as screen width decreases.
* In hamburger menu, want menu to disappear once menu item is clicked.
* Look up how to make contact page (and how to prevent spam?)
* ^ Think about making it booking page? Booking inquiry?
* Make image in about-page covered by a circle.
* Make image text go-to once-column once in phone-width (make same as header)
* Make placeholder gallery page.
